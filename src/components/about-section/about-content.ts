    'I am a seasoned engineer with 7-8 years of experience in various domains, specializing in back-end development and DevOps. However, I also have a knack for front-end development. Currently, I am contributing to Joyn Gmbh in Munich, where I am strengthening their content pipelines to be more robust, high-performing, and versatile. Additionally, I assist our content partners such as Prosieben Sat 1., Discovery, etc. in efficiently utilizing these pipelines to provide content to our users.

When I am not upgrading existing code or devising new systems, I enjoy pursuing my hobbies of travelling or indulging in DIY projects like building 3D printers or tinkering with electronics to create innovative solutions.'
