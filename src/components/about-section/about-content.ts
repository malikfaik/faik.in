    'I am an experienced engineer who has worked in several different spaces over the last 6 years, I strongly believe in being a test first and a language agnostic engineer. As of now I am working with Joyn Gmbh in Munich, helping them make content pipelines more robust, performant and generic for our partners. \nWhen I am not upgrading legacy code or playing around with my pet projects, I am either playing games, travelling or just tinkering with some 3d printers and electronics.'
