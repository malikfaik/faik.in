    "I am from Kashmir, India based in Munich, Germany. I started freelancing during later half of my school. I believe in being language agnostic, I treat language as a tool and not as a skill, the skill for me is investigating and designing solutions and using the best language available to implement that solution. \nI also put high importance on having fun while you work, I am a human not a robot, I enjoy my work and I make sure everyone else who works with me enjoy their's too."
