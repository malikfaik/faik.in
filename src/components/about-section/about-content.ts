    'I am an experienced engineer who has worked in several different spaces over the last 6 years, I strongly believe in being a test first and language agonistic when it comes to engineering. Currently, I am working as a Back-end engineer with Joyn Gmbh in Munich, Germany. \nApart from engineering, I am a noob gamer, I like travelling and I love tinkering with electronics, 3d printers etc.'
