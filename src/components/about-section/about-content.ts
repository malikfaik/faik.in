    'I am an experienced engineer having worked in several different spaces over the last 7-8 years, my core expertise is in Back-end and DevOps but I dabble in Front-end as well every now and then. Currently, I am working with Joyn Gmbh in Munich, helping them make content pipelines more robust, performant and generic, and also supporting our content partners like Prosieben Sat 1., Discovery etc, to effectively use these pipelines to deliver content to our users.\nWhen I am not upgrading legacy code, designing new systems or tinkering with my pet projects, I am either travelling or just hacking on 3d printers, electronics to build something cool.'
