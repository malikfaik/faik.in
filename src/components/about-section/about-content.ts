Currently, I am working as a Backend Engineer with Trivago N.V., I hail from Srinagar, Kashmir, which is the nothernmost part of India. On a random day you can find me either gaming, travelling or just fixing up some scripts. \nFrom engineering side of things, I believe in being language agnostic as that gives me the freedom to choose the best tool / language available for the job and not marrying a single technology for life.'
